## Overview

Adds the spacial anomaly from Goonstation, a large rift which spans through the map and is impassable unless if you have means of teleporting over it, or if you take the disposals pipes. It lasts for a small ammount of time before dissapearing, generally serving more as an annoyance to be circumvented than anything actually harmful.

## How it works

It is a random event picked from the pool like any other, it would spawn an anchored entity which functions as an impassable walls and crosses the entire map, and would last between 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on the severity of the event. It also plays the following message from Centcom: "A severe spatial anomaly has been detected near the station. Personnel are advised to avoid any unusual phenomenae."


## Why?

More variety to the current event pool, and is also an innofensive and yet unusual event that can force the players into unusual situations.
